Once the DMS application has been installed by the appropriate Salesforce (SF) Administrator, there are still some steps required before the application is ready to use. The remaining steps described in this guide may be performed by the DMS Admin (unless otherwise noted) and no longer require the SF Admin.
The Document Management System (DMS) Admin User can perform most primary administration functions such as restoring a document version, document check-out, obsolete an effective document. There are also many configuration and user management tasks that the DMS Admin supports. These tasks and operations do not require Salesforce Admin privileges.
There are other administrative functions such as initial setup, onboarding of users, creating profiles and departments that can only be performed by the Salesforce system administrator. These tasks are described separately in the DMS Admin Configuration Guide.
